/**
    * This file is used for animating animations of UI elements and makes use of
    * Vectore2.Lerp(), Coroutine, and Time.deltaTime.
    * Simply attach this script to a GameObject with a RectTransform component
    * to animate it.
    *
    * The animation can run thanks to coroutines that are used to animate the
    * GameObject. The animation can be of different types, such as scaling from
    * 0 to 1, or moving from one position to another.
    *
    * Time.deltaTime is used to make the animation smooth and independent of the
    * frame rate. It does not make use of the Update() function for this as it
    * is recommended to control animations with coroutines.

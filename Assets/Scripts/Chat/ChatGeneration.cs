/* BY: ALIN
this script has a function called GenerateMessage which returns one [1] string containing a thing that
our chat would be saying at this point in time, based on some numbers corresponding to what the player
is doing right now.

ideally GenerateMessage should be called at different speeds, faster for when the monster is around
and much slower when nothing is happening
